**Marathon**

We're delighted to introduce a new event, the awesomest in the history of liantichess: the [antichess marathon!](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/tournament/ZLsdnR8T)

This is a liantichess arena bullet tournament. Except **it lasts 24 hours**. It is a battle of **endurance**, where the will and resistance of players will be put to the proof!

**The winner gets the unique blue globe trophy** on their profile page forever; pretty much like the [Liantichess WC trophy](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/static/images/trophy/acwc21.png). Top fifteen players receive a trophy!

When does it start? This **Saturday 9th April, starting at 4:00 UTC**. See [the marathon page](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/tournament/ZLsdnR8T) for your timezone.

Who can enter? **Everybody!** Click "Join" on [the marathon page](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/tournament/ZLsdnR8T) [(you need to log in)](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/login).

What are the games settings? 2+1 rated, antichess, random color.

How does the tournament work? You get paired automatically with opponents close to you in the tournament standing. [Read more about liantichess arena tournaments](https://lichess.org/tournament/help?system=arena).

Can I sleep? Yes, just **withdraw** the tournament. You can **join back later and keep all your points**.

Is coffee/tea authorized? Yes, you're going to need it.

Is cheating authorized? No, it will get you a swift ban as usual.

Don't you think this is unhealthy? Indeed. We decline all responsibility in case of epic tilt.

What are the prizes? The winner takes the unique blue globe trophy home. Top ten players and top fifty also receive a trophy.

Now train and rest before the event starts! May the best and **craziest of us be victorious!**
