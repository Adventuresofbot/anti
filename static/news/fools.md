# Liantichess's database is lost

Liantichess's Mongodb database is lost, It will delete all your games, and all the user accounts, and it will empty the oceans, silence the birds and shut down the sun.

[EDIT] This post was an April fools joke. Liantichess's data will never be lost, until mongodb is alive.

Today, I saw and confirmed that the database is fully lost while checking the db.

It had long been known by us moderators and developers that the database is lost. We are tired, bored and disenchanted with trying to recover the database. Most recently, the updates to the user interface which increased the user activities and created a marvelous change to the interface. But unfortunately the users accounts and the games even everything is going to be erased in next server restart.

So its impossible to access old or even recent information's of users, games, tournaments etc. so if server restarted liantichess server may go crazy with unclear directions and blast fully.

Have a good April Fools.
